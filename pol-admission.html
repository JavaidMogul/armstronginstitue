        <p class="lead">
            This policy applies to the admission of applicants to the following awards:  
        </p>
         <dl class="p-2" >
             <dd>&#9642; Award coursework study in higher education including domestic and international, onshore and offshore. /dd>

            <h2 class="display-5">SECTION 4</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Policy Statement</h3>
        <p>
            AI believes in equal access to educational opportunities by people of all backgrounds, experiences, and abilities. In the case of international onshore students, the AI abides by current state and federal government requirements, e.g., assessing an applicant as being a genuine temporary entrant. Students applying to study off-shore by on-line must attend at least one unit offered by on-shore learning. <br><br>
            AI actively seeks to engage with and serve the local community (and will be developing a Community Service IT program). <br> 
            AI is committed to the principles of admissions transparency as outlined by the Higher Education   Higher Education Standards Framework and the Services for Overseas Students Act. <br><br>
            As per the TEQSA Student Retention Policy and Guidelines, AI  is committed to supporting the success of all its students and proactively working to retain and enrich their experiences during their studies. <br><br>
            For these reasons, it is AI’s goal, where possible, to be able to offer every applicant a place, whether in the course or program to which they apply, or in another suitable course. This may include the offer of a pathway course or enabling course to address particular learning needs of the student (e.g., an English language or research-intensive courses as a precursor to an award course). <br><br>
            In order to be eligible for selection an applicant must satisfy AI admission criteria, a course’s specific admission criteria, and complete any selection tasks. <br><br>
            Satisfaction of these requirements permits an applicant to be considered for a place but does not guarantee an offer of a place. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.1 Basis for Admission</h4>
        <div class="p-3">
            <p>
            Admission offers are made to applicants who are assessed to have the background and abilities to

            All applicants must meet the English language requirements for the level of study for which they are seeking entry. Minimum English language requirements are stated in the Procedure for Admission.

                <p>
                   AI acknowledges that some people may have circumstances that mean that their ability to demonstrate their capacity via typical means will be limited. AI will consider admission for such people on a case-by-case basis, as detailed in the Admissions Procedure and varied from time to time. <br>
                   AI uses multiple modes of entry in admitting students, including but not limited to:

                    <dd>&#9642; <em>Group C </em>– AI acknowledges the importance of recognising an applicant's prior learning through study or work experience wherever possible and appropriate. AI will provide advanced standing to students who provide evidence of learning in line with AQF Qualifications pathway.

                <p>
                    In particular, applicants for higher degree by research places will be assessed for suitability against the available pool of expert supervisors to ensure that AI can properly acquit its 	responsibility to the applicant. <br><br>
                    AI will not offer places in specific courses in excess of what the AI reasonably believes it can service.<br><br>
